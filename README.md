Key developments include a range of novel techniques to generate and track practically feasible trajectories, recover from large disturbances, and the ability to perform complex manipulation tasks. The framework is an important step towards safe and reliable aerial manipulation.},

#### Package Name
The name `jetstream` is homage to the fast-flowing air currents in the high-atmosphere which can be used to improve aircraft performance (under specific conditions).
